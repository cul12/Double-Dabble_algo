# Double-Dabble_algo
This project implements the Double-Dabble algorithm for binary to BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) conversion using combinational logic circuits. The design focuses on efficient hardware implementation with minimal gate delay and resource utilization.

Key Features:
1. Designed and simulated using Proteus, utilizing logic gates, adders, and comparators.
2. Supports binary inputs up to 8 bits, ensuring accurate BCD conversion.
3. Optimized for hardware implementation, reducing delay and improving efficiency.
